# Introduction to Nocturnal Skirmish

### 1. What is Nocturnal Skirmish?

* Nocturnal skirmish is a pixelart turn-based PvP card game, made in godot engine.

### 2. What's the purpose of this project?

* Our goal is to make a fun and technically advanced strategy card game.

### 3. What happened to the original Nocturnal Skirmish & GameHub (social hub and game)?

* The original game was not up to our standards, so we decided to archive it and start to work on a remake.

### 4. What will happen to the website itself (nocskir.com)?

* The website will be remade into a wiki page with tutorials and information usefull to the game, but will not host the game itself anymore. Also GameHub, which was a social platform, is not being included in the remake.
